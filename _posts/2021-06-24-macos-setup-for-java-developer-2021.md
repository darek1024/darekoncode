Mac OS is the most productive environment for me as a Java Developer. 
As I was recently setting up a new machine for my day to day work, 
I decided to write down applications and tools that help me to be productive every day. 


## General Purpose Applications

1. **1Password** - for storing credentials to ever-growing number of websites & services.
2. **Dropbox** - for keeping my important files in cloud, so I'm not afraid of loosing a machine.
3. **FantastiCal** - replacement for built-in Calendar application. It has wider range of options, and it shows me upcoming event on the tray bray at the top. I use companion apps on iPhone & Apple Watch as well.
4. **Nozbe** - for keeping myself organized. I keep all my important tasks there, so I don't need to keep them in my head.
5. **Spark Mail** - desktop email client. Works as well on iPhone & Apple Watch.
6. **Spotify** - for listening to music to help me focus.
